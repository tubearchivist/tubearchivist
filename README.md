## Core functionality
Once your YouTube video collection grows, it becomes hard to search and find a specific video. That's where Tube Archivist comes in: By indexing your video collection with metadata from YouTube, you can organize, search and enjoy your archived YouTube videos without hassle offline through a convenient web interface. This includes:
* Subscribe to your favorite YouTube channels
* Download Videos using **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)**
* Index and make videos searchable
* Play videos
* Keep track of viewed and unviewed videos

## Installing
For minimal system requirements, the Tube Archivist stack needs around 2GB of available memory for a small testing setup and around 4GB of available memory for a mid to large sized installation. Minimal with dual core with 4 threads, better quad core plus.
This project requires docker. Ensure it is installed and running on your system.

The documentation has additional user provided instructions for [Unraid](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/unraid/), [Synology](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/synology/) and [Podman](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/podman/).

## Update
Always use the *latest* (the default) or a named semantic version tag for the docker images. The *unstable* tags are only for your testing environment, there might not be an update path for these testing builds.

You will see the current version number of **Tube Archivist** in the footer of the interface. There is a daily version check task querying tubearchivist.com, notifying you of any new releases in the footer. To update, you need to update the docker images, the method for which will depend on your platform. For example, if you're using `docker-compose`, run `docker-compose pull` and then restart with `docker-compose up -d`. After updating, check the footer to verify you are running the expected version.

  - This project is tested for updates between one or two releases maximum. Further updates back may or may not be supported and you might have to reset your index and configurations to update. Ideally apply new updates at least once per month.
  - There can be breaking changes between updates, particularly as the application grows, new environment variables or settings might be required for you to set in the your docker-compose file. *Always* check the **release notes**: Any breaking changes will be marked there.
  - All testing and development is done with the Elasticsearch version number as mentioned in the provided *docker-compose.yml* file. This will be updated when a new release of Elasticsearch is available. Running an older version of Elasticsearch is most likely not going to result in any issues, but it's still recommended to run the same version as mentioned. Use `bbilly1/tubearchivist-es` to automatically get the recommended version.

## Getting Started
1. Go through the **settings** page and look at the available options. Particularly set *Download Format* to your desired video quality before downloading. **Tube Archivist** downloads the best available quality by default. To support iOS or MacOS and some other browsers a compatible format must be specified. For example:
```
bestvideo[vcodec*=avc1]+bestaudio[acodec*=mp4a]/mp4
```
2. Subscribe to some of your favorite YouTube channels on the **channels** page.
3. On the **downloads** page, click on *Rescan subscriptions* to add videos from the subscribed channels to your Download queue or click on *Add to download queue* to manually add Video IDs, links, channels or playlists.
4. Click on *Start download* and let **Tube Archivist** to it's thing.
5. Enjoy your archived collection!


### Port Collisions
If you have a collision on port `8000`, best solution is to use dockers *HOST_PORT* and *CONTAINER_PORT* distinction: To for example change the interface to port 9000 use `9000:8000` in your docker-compose file.

For more information on port collisions, check the docs.

## Common Errors
Here is a list of common errors and their solutions.

### `vm.max_map_count`
**Elastic Search** in Docker requires the kernel setting of the host machine `vm.max_map_count` to be set to at least 262144.

To temporary set the value run:
```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
To apply the change permanently depends on your host operating system:

 - For example on Ubuntu Server add `vm.max_map_count = 262144` to the file `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
 - On Arch based systems create a file `/etc/sysctl.d/max_map_count.conf` with the content `vm.max_map_count = 262144`.
 - On any other platform look up in the documentation on how to pass kernel parameters.


### Permissions for elasticsearch
If you see a message similar to `Unable to access 'path.repo' (/usr/share/elasticsearch/data/snapshot)` or `failed to obtain node locks, tried [/usr/share/elasticsearch/data]` and `maybe these locations are not writable` when initially starting elasticsearch, that probably means the container is not allowed to write files to the volume.
To fix that issue, shutdown the container and on your host machine run:
```
chown 1000:0 -R /path/to/mount/point
```
This will match the permissions with the **UID** and **GID** of elasticsearch process within the container and should fix the issue.


### Disk usage
The Elasticsearch index will turn to ***read only*** if the disk usage of the container goes above 95% until the usage drops below 90% again, you will see error messages like `disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark`.

Similar to that, TubeArchivist will become all sorts of messed up when running out of disk space. There are some error messages in the logs when that happens, but it's best to make sure to have enough disk space before starting to download.

## `error setting rlimit`
If you are seeing errors like `failed to create shim: OCI runtime create failed` and `error during container init: error setting rlimits`, this means docker can't set these limits, usually because they are set at another place or are incompatible because of other reasons. Solution is to remove the `ulimits` key from the ES container in your docker compose and start again.

This can happen if you have nested virtualizations, e.g. LXC running Docker in Proxmox.

## Known limitations
- Video files created by Tube Archivist need to be playable in your browser of choice. Not every codec is compatible with every browser and might require some testing with format selection.
- Every limitation of **yt-dlp** will also be present in Tube Archivist. If **yt-dlp** can't download or extract a video for any reason, Tube Archivist won't be able to either.
- There is no flexibility in naming of the media files.
