# Security

This example deploy a 3 nodes Elasticsearch 7.15.0 with authentication and
autogenerated certificates for TLS (see [values][]).

Note that this configuration should be used for test only. For a production
deployment you should generate SSL certificates following the [official docs][].

## Usage

* Create the required secrets: `make secrets`

* Deploy Elasticsearch chart with the default values: `make install`

* You can now setup a port forward to query Elasticsearch API:

  ```
  kubectl port-forward svc/security-master 9200
  curl -u elastic:changeme https://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
  ```

## Testing

You can also run [goss integration tests][] using `make test`
